You can access the app here:  
https://phcs93.github.io/group-file-studio/

# Features

- you can replace or edit the PALETTE.DAT and export the modified file
- you can replace or edit the LOOKUP.DAT and export the modified file
- you can replace or edit the the .ART files and export the modified files (not functional yet)

# TO-DO

- ability to replace a tile with some .PNG
    - figure out how to convert uploaded image to palette
- ability to edit animations (because these will be messed by the tile reordering)
- optimize all loops
- figure out the transparency table (alpha blending?)
- ability to upload/edit/export a tiles.cfg (for Mapster32 tile groups)
- make it look more like mapster
- validate uploaded files (for example, check if the GRP is a valid GRP)

# BUG

- cant scroll while dragging
