# Lookup File Editor

A tool for editing LOOKUP.DAT files from Build Engine games.

You need to load up a PALETTE.DAT, LOOKUP.DAT and optionally an .ART file.

Then you select a swap palette in the menu to edit.

First you need to click on the palette color you want to use from the PALETTE.DAT color table (kinda like a brush).

Then you can click on the index at the LOOKUP.DAT table you want to change to the color you selected.

After you're done, click on the "EXPORT MODIFIED LOOKUP.DAT" to download your modified file.

You can access the app here:
